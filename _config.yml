  During my Ph.D. studies, I analyzed the physics data generated by the CMS detector at the CERN European Nuclear 
  Research Center. In this process, I had the opportunity to work with scientists from around the world in terms 
  of collaboration and working as a team, as well as technical issues such as programming, big data analysis, 
  statistical analysis, etc. Before I was at CERN, I did physics analysis at Fermilab at the United States for a year.

  In order to improve myself as a data scientist, I started Data Camp's Data Scientist career course with using Python. 
  In this course, I learned how to use Python programming, Numpy, Pandas Foundation to clean up data, to configure and 
  group data and to analyze the data from different databases and file attachments using the python programming. 
  I learned how to visualize these processes with matplotlib, seaborn and Bokeh using many real data. In the last part, 
  the machine learning completed with Supervised Learning with scikit-learn, Unspervısed learning ın Python, Deep 
  learning and Network Analysis in Python.
