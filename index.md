## Data Science Project
### House Price Prediction:Kaggle Competition
In this Kaggle competition, I have been predicting the house price with a lot of explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Python programming and regression techniques like the random forest were used in this competition. Please follow the link to see Kaggle's notebook.

### Titanic Machine Learning Competition
The competition is: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived on the Titanic shipwreck.I used predictive modeling to find out the best algorithm to predict survived people. Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Radical Support Vector MAchine, DEcison Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest algorithm has been used to find the best model. Please visit the Kaggle notebook for more information.

## Data Analysis 
### Investigating TMDB Movie Datasets
In this project, I have been used the TMDB movies dataset which is collected between 1960 to 2015 with the information of title, budget, revenue, cast, director, genres, release date, release year, runtime, etc The primary goal of the project is making the exploratory data analysis using numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib library.
